Let's address each question step by step:

### Question 1:

Given X is a discrete random variable with the following PMF:

\[ P(X) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.2 & \text{if } X = 0.2 \\
0.3 & \text{if } X = 0.5 \\
0.5 & \text{if } X = 0.8 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

1. **Range of \( X \) (denoted as \( R_X \)):**
   The range of \( X \) is the set of all possible values that \( X \) can take, which in this case is \( R_X = \{0.2, 0.5, 0.8\} \).

2. **\( P(X \leq 0.5) \):**
   \[ P(X \leq 0.5) = P(X = 0.2) + P(X = 0.5) = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5 \]

3. **\( P(0.25 < X < 0.75) \):**
   Since \( 0.25 < X < 0.75 \) only includes \( X = 0.5 \), \( P(0.25 < X < 0.75) = P(X = 0.5) = 0.3 \).

4. **\( P(X = 0.2|X < 0.6) \):**
   Given \( X < 0.6 \), the only relevant value is \( X = 0.5 \), so \( P(X = 0.2|X < 0.6) = 0 \).

### Question 2:

Given two dice are rolled, and we observe two numbers \( X \) and \( Y \):

1. **Ranges and PMFs of \( X \) and \( Y \):**
   \( R_X = R_Y = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \) since both dice have 6 sides, and they are fair, so \( P(X = x) = P(Y = y) = \frac{1}{6} \) for \( x, y \) in \( R_X \) and \( R_Y \).

2. **\( P(X = 2, Y = 6) \):**
   Since the outcomes of rolling two dice are independent, \( P(X = 2, Y = 6) = P(X = 2) \times P(Y = 6) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36} \).

3. **\( P(X > 3|Y = 2) \):**
   Since \( Y = 2 \), the possible outcomes for \( X \) are \( \{1, 2\} \). Thus, \( P(X > 3|Y = 2) = 0 \) since no outcome of \( X \) satisfies \( X > 3 \) given \( Y = 2 \).

4. **Range and PMF of \( Z = X + Y \):**
   \( Z \) can take values from 2 to 12. The PMF of \( Z \) depends on the sum of the individual PMFs of \( X \) and \( Y \) for each value of \( Z \).

5. **\( P(X = 4|Z = 8) \):**
   To find \( P(X = 4|Z = 8) \), we need to consider all possible pairs \( (X, Y) \) that sum up to 8 and find the probability of \( X \) being 4.

### Question 3:

In an exam with 20 multiple-choice questions:

- For the known questions, the student's score follows a binomial distribution.
- For the unknown questions, the student's score follows a hypergeometric distribution.

We need to calculate the PMF of \( X \) (the total score) and then find \( P(X > 15) \).

### Question 4:

Given the number of students arriving at a college between 10 am and 11:30 am follows a Poisson distribution with \( \lambda = 10 \) per hour. We need to find \( P(10 < Y \leq 15) \).

### Question 5:

Given two independent random variables \( X \) and \( Y \) following Poisson distributions, we need to find the PMF of their sum \( Z = X + Y \).

### Question 6:

Given a discrete random variable \( X \), we define a new random variable \( Y = (X + 1)^2 \). We need to find the range and PMF of \( Y \).

### Question 7:

Given \( X \) is a continuous random variable with a specified PDF, we need to find \( E(X) \), \( \text{Var}(X) \), and \( P(X \geq c) \).

### Question 8:

Given \( X \) is a continuous random variable with a specified PDF, we need to find the PDF of \( Y = \sin(X) \).

### Question 9:

Given \( X \) is a continuous random variable with a specified CDF, we need to determine the type of random variable \( X \), find its PDF, calculate \( E(e^X) \), and find \( P(X = 0|X \leq 0.5) \).

### Question 10:

Given joint PMFs of \( X \) and \( Y \), we need to find probabilities related to \( X \) and \( Y \), determine their marginal PMFs, and investigate if they are independent.

### Question 11:

Given a scenario of selecting shirts from a box without replacement, we need to find the joint PMF of \( X \) and \( Y \).

### Question 12:

Given joint PDFs of two continuous random variables, we need to find marginal PDFs, determine independence, find conditional PDFs, calculate conditional expectations, and find conditional variances.

### Question 13:

Given a scenario of men's weights on a ship, we need to find the probability that the total weight exceeds a certain threshold.

### Question 14:

Given independent and identically distributed random variables, we need to apply the central limit theorem to estimate a probability.
