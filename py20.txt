1. Set the variable test1 to the string 'This is a test of the emergency text system,' and save test1 to a file named test.txt.

test1 = 'This is a test of the emergency text system,'
with open('test.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(test1)


2. Read the contents of the file test.txt into the variable test2. Is there a difference between test1 and test2?

with open('test.txt', 'r') as file:
    test2 = file.read()

print(test1 == test2)  # Should print True if the contents are the same

3. Create a CSV file called books.csv:

with open('books.csv', 'w') as file:
    file.write('''title,author,year
The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,Alan Garner,1960
Perdido Street Station,China Mi√©ville,2000
Thud!,Terry Pratchett,2005
The Spellman Files,Lisa Lutz,2007
Small Gods,Terry Pratchett,1992
''')

4. Use the sqlite3 module to create a SQLite database called books.db and a table called books:

import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE books
                  (title TEXT, author TEXT, year INTEGER)''')

connection.commit()
connection.close()

5. Read books.csv and insert its data into the book table:

import csv

connection = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

with open('books.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip the header
    for row in reader:
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO books VALUES (?, ?, ?)', row)

connection.commit()
connection.close()

6. Select and print the title column from the book table in alphabetical order:

connection = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('SELECT title FROM books ORDER BY title')
titles = cursor.fetchall()
for title in titles:
    print(title[0])

connection.close()

7. From the book table, select and print all columns in the order of publication:

connection = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY year')
books = cursor.fetchall()
for book in books:
    print(book)

connection.close()

8. Use the sqlalchemy module to connect to the sqlite3 database books.db:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///books.db')
connection = engine.connect()
metadata = MetaData()
books_table = Table('books', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)


9. Install the Redis server and the Python redis library (pip install redis) on your computer. Create a Redis hash called test with the fields count (1) and name ('Fester Bestertester'). Print all the fields for test.

import redis

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Create Redis hash
r.hmset('test', {'count': 1, 'name': 'Fester Bestertester'})

# Print all fields for test
print(r.hgetall('test'))


10. Increment the count field of test and print it.


# Increment the count field of test
r.hincrby('test', 'count', 1)

# Print the updated count field
print(r.hget('test', 'count'))
