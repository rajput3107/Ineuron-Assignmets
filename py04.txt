1. `[]` represents an empty list in Python.
2. To assign the value `'hello'` as the third value in the list stored in the variable `spam`, you would use the following code:
   
   spam = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   spam[2] = 'hello'

3. The value of `spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]` is `spam[3]`, which corresponds to the fourth element in the list `'d'`.
4. The value of `spam[-1]` is the last element of the list, which is `'d'`.
5. The value of `spam[:2]` is `['a', 'b']`.
6. The value of `bacon.index('cat')` is 1, as it returns the index of the first occurrence of the string `'cat'` in the list `bacon`.
7. The `bacon.append(99)` method adds the value `99` to the end of the list `bacon`, so the list becomes `[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]`.
8. The `bacon.remove('cat')` method removes the first occurrence of the string `'cat'` from the list `bacon`. After this operation, the list becomes `[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]`.
9. The list concatenation operator is `+`, and the list replication operator is `*`.
10. The `append()` method adds an item to the end of a list, whereas the `insert()` method inserts an item at a specified index.
11. The two methods for removing items from a list are `remove()` and `pop()`.
12. Both list values and string values can be indexed and sliced, can be used in loops, can be concatenated or replicated, and support the `len()` function to determine their length.
13. Tuples and lists are both sequences in Python, but lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
14. To type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42, you would use parentheses:
    
    my_tuple = (42,)
 
15. To get a list value's tuple form, you use the `tuple()` function, and to get a tuple value's list form, you use the `list()` function.
16. Variables that "contain" list values are actually storing references to the list values.
17. `copy.copy()` creates a shallow copy of an object, which means it copies the object itself and any references to other objects, but not the objects those references point to. `copy.deepcopy()` creates a deep copy of an object, meaning it copies the object and recursively copies all objects that it references, and all objects referenced by those objects, and so on.
