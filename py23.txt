### 1.

**Output:** `1 2 8`

**Explanation:** In this function call, `func(1, 2)`, the argument `1` is assigned to `a` and `2` is assigned to `b`, but `c` retains its default value `8` since no value is provided for it during the function call.

### 2.

**Output:** `1 2 3`

**Explanation:** Here, during the function call `func(1, c=3, b=2)`, the arguments `1`, `2`, and `3` are assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Even though the order of `b` and `c` is different from the function definition, the keyword arguments explicitly specify which value goes to which parameter.

### 3.

**Output:** `1 (2, 3)`

**Explanation:** The `*pargs` parameter in the function definition allows any number of positional arguments to be passed after the first one (`a`). In this case, `a` gets `1`, and the remaining arguments `(2, 3)` are collected into a tuple and assigned to `pargs`.

### 4.

**Output:** `1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}`

**Explanation:** The `**kargs` parameter in the function definition allows any number of keyword arguments to be passed. In this case, `a` gets `1`, and the rest of the keyword arguments (`c=3` and `b=2`) are collected into a dictionary and assigned to `kargs`.

### 5.

**Output:** `1 5 6 5`

**Explanation:** The `*(5, 6)` syntax is used to unpack the tuple `(5, 6)` into individual arguments. So, effectively, the function call becomes `func(1, 5, 6)`, where `1` is assigned to `a`, `5` is assigned to `b`, `6` is assigned to `c` (since it corresponds to the third parameter), and `d` retains its default value `5`.

 6.

**Output:** `1 ['x'] {'a': 'y'}`

**Explanation:** 
- The variable `l` remains unchanged since integers are immutable and not affected by changes inside the function.
- The list `m` is mutable, so changes made to it inside the function reflect outside the function as well. Thus, `m` becomes `['x']`.
- The dictionary `n` is also mutable, so changes made to it inside the function reflect outside the function. Thus, `n` becomes `{'a': 'y'}`.
