1. RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors using combinations of red, green, and blue, along with an alpha channel that represents the opacity of the color.

2. In the Pillow module, you can get the RGBA value of any image pixel using the `getpixel()` method. For example:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image

   # Open an image file
   img = Image.open('example_image.jpg')

   # Get the RGBA value of a pixel at position (x, y)
   rgba_value = img.getpixel((x, y))
   ```

3. A box tuple in Pillow represents a rectangular region in an image. It is a tuple of four integers `(left, top, right, bottom)` that define the region where:
   - `left` is the x-coordinate of the left edge of the box,
   - `top` is the y-coordinate of the top edge of the box,
   - `right` is the x-coordinate of the right edge of the box, and
   - `bottom` is the y-coordinate of the bottom edge of the box.

   This tuple is commonly used to define regions of interest, cropping areas, or bounding boxes in images.

4. To find out the width and height of an Image object in a Jupyter notebook, you can use the `.size` attribute:

   width, height = img.size


5. To get an Image object for a 100Ã—100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use the `crop()` method:

   img_cropped = img.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))  # Excludes the lower-left quarter
   

6. After making changes to an Image object, you can save it as an image file using the `save()` method:
 
   img.save('output_image.jpg')  # Save the image as a JPEG file
 

7. Pillow's shape-drawing code is contained within the `ImageDraw` module.

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. Instead, drawing methods are provided by the `ImageDraw` object, which is obtained by calling `ImageDraw.Draw(image)` where `image` is an Image object. This object provides methods for drawing shapes, text, and other graphical elements on the image.
