1. **Sequence-to-sequence models**:
   - Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are neural network architectures designed to transform sequences from one domain into sequences in another domain.
   - They consist of an encoder network that processes the input sequence and captures its semantic representation, followed by a decoder network that generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation.
   - Seq2seq models are widely used in machine translation, text summarization, speech recognition, and other sequence generation tasks.

2. **Problems with Vanilla RNNs**:
   - Vanishing gradients: Vanilla RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become extremely small as they backpropagate through time, leading to ineffective learning and long-term dependency issues.
   - Exploding gradients: Conversely, gradients can explode during training, causing instability and difficulty in optimization.
   - Difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies: Vanilla RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies in sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem, limiting their effectiveness in tasks that require understanding of long-range dependencies.

3. **Gradient clipping**:
   - Gradient clipping is a technique used to prevent the exploding gradient problem during training.
   - It involves rescaling gradients if their norm exceeds a predefined threshold.
   - By clipping gradients, the optimization process becomes more stable, preventing large updates that can lead to model divergence.

4. **Attention mechanism**:
   - Attention mechanism is a mechanism in neural networks that allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions.
   - Instead of processing the entire input sequence at once, attention mechanisms assign different weights to different parts of the input sequence based on their relevance to the current prediction.
   - Attention mechanisms are commonly used in sequence-to-sequence models, enabling them to selectively attend to relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding.

5. **Conditional random fields (CRFs)**:
   - Conditional random fields are probabilistic graphical models used for structured prediction tasks, particularly in sequence labeling problems such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.
   - CRFs model the conditional probability distribution of labels given input features, capturing dependencies between neighboring labels.
   - They often outperform simpler models like hidden Markov models (HMMs) by considering global features and dependencies.

6. **Self-attention**:
   - Self-attention is a mechanism that computes attention weights by comparing different positions of a single sequence.
   - It allows each position in the sequence to attend to other positions, capturing relationships and dependencies between different parts of the sequence.
   - Self-attention is a key component of transformer architectures, enabling them to model long-range dependencies efficiently.

7. **Bahdanau Attention**:
   - Bahdanau Attention is a type of attention mechanism introduced in the context of neural machine translation.
   - It allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically during the generation of each output token.
   - Bahdanau Attention computes attention scores based on the alignment between the decoder's current hidden state and the encoder's output states.

8. **Language Model**:
   - A language model is a probabilistic model that assigns probabilities to sequences of words in a language.
   - It captures the statistical properties of natural language, such as word frequencies, word sequences, and syntactic structures.
   - Language models are used in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.

9. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   - Multi-Head Attention is an extension of the self-attention mechanism where the attention mechanism is applied multiple times in parallel.
   - Each attention head learns to focus on different aspects of the input sequence, enabling the model to capture different types of information.
   - Multi-Head Attention is a key component of transformer architectures, allowing them to model complex relationships and dependencies in sequences.

10. **Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)**:
    - BLEU is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to one or more human-reference translations.
    - It measures the precision of n-grams (typically up to 4-grams) generated by the machine translation system compared to the reference translations.
    - BLEU scores range between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating better translation quality relative to the reference translations.
