1. `shutil.copy()` is used to copy a single file from one location to another. `shutil.copytree()` is used to recursively copy an entire directory tree from one location to another.

2. The `os.rename()` function is commonly used to rename files in Python.

3. The difference between the delete functions in the `send2trash` and `shutil` modules lies in their behavior. The `send2trash` module sends files to the operating system's trash or recycle bin, allowing for potential recovery, whereas `shutil` functions like `shutil.rmtree()` irreversibly delete files and directories.

4. The method equivalent to File objects' `open()` method for `ZipFile` objects is `ZipFile()` itself, as it is used to create a new ZipFile object, just like `open()` is used to open files in various modes.

5. Below is a Python program that searches a folder tree for files with a specified file extension (e.g., `.pdf` or `.jpg`) and copies them to a new folder:


import os
import shutil

def search_and_copy_files(root_folder, target_extension, destination_folder):
    # Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
        os.makedirs(destination_folder)

    # Walk through the directory tree
    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(root_folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            # Check if the file has the desired extension
            if filename.endswith(target_extension):
                # Construct the absolute path of the source and destination files
                source_file = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
                destination_file = os.path.join(destination_folder, filename)

                # Copy the file to the destination folder
                shutil.copy(source_file, destination_file)
                print(f"Copied {filename} to {destination_folder}")

# Example usage:
root_folder = "/path/to/root/folder"
target_extension = ".pdf"  # Change this to the desired file extension
destination_folder = "/path/to/destination/folder"
search_and_copy_files(root_folder, target_extension, destination_folder)
