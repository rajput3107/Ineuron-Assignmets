1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.

from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
with open('today.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(current_date)

2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string.

with open('today.txt', 'r') as file:
    today_string = file.read()


3. Parse the date from today_string.

from datetime import datetime

parsed_date = datetime.strptime(today_string, '%Y-%m-%d')
print(parsed_date)

4. List the files in your current directory.

import os

files_in_current_directory = os.listdir('.')
print(files_in_current_directory)

5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).

files_in_parent_directory = os.listdir('..')
print(files_in_parent_directory[:5])

6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.

import multiprocessing
import time
import random

def print_current_time():
    time.sleep(random.randint(1, 5))
    current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", time.localtime())
    print("Current time:", current_time)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    processes = []
    for _ in range(3):
        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_current_time)
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    for process in processes:
        process.join()


7. Create a date object of your day of birth.

from datetime import date

date_of_birth = date(1990, 5, 15)  # Example date of birth (YYYY, MM, DD)
print(date_of_birth)


8. What day of the week was your day of birth?

day_of_week = date_of_birth.strftime('%A')
print("Day of the week of my birth:", day_of_week)

9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?

from datetime import timedelta

ten_thousand_days = date_of_birth + timedelta(days=10000)
print("I will be (or was) 10,000 days old on:", ten_thousand_days)
