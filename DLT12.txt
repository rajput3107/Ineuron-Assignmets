1. **How does `unsqueeze` help us to solve certain broadcasting problems?**
   - `unsqueeze` helps us to add a new dimension to a tensor at the specified position. This is useful for aligning tensor shapes during broadcasting operations, where tensors with different dimensions need to be operated on elementwise.

2. **How can we use indexing to do the same operation as `unsqueeze`?**
   - We can use indexing with `None` to achieve the same operation as `unsqueeze`. For example:
     ```python
     import torch

     x = torch.randn(3)
     y = x[:, None]  # Equivalent to unsqueeze(1)
     ```

3. **How do we show the actual contents of the memory used for a tensor?**
   - To show the actual contents of the memory used for a tensor, you can use the `numpy` method `np.array(tensor)` to convert the tensor to a NumPy array and then print it.

4. **When adding a vector of size 3 to a matrix of size 3×3, are the elements of the vector added to each row or each column of the matrix?**
   - When adding a vector of size 3 to a matrix of size 3×3, the elements of the vector are added to each column of the matrix, resulting in the vector being added elementwise to each column.

5. **Do broadcasting and `expand_as` result in increased memory use? Why or why not?**
   - No, broadcasting and `expand_as` do not result in increased memory use. They are implemented in a memory-efficient manner in most deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. These operations manipulate tensor metadata rather than copying or expanding the underlying data.

6. **Implement `matmul` using Einstein summation:**
   - Here's how you can implement `matmul` using Einstein summation notation:
     ```python
     import torch

     def matmul_einsum(A, B):
         return torch.einsum('ij,jk->ik', A, B)

     # Example usage:
     A = torch.randn(3, 4)
     B = torch.randn(4, 5)
     C = matmul_einsum(A, B)
     print(C)
     ```

7. **What does a repeated index letter represent on the lefthand side of `einsum`?**
   - A repeated index letter on the lefthand side of `einsum` represents a summation over that index. It indicates that the corresponding dimensions of the input arrays will be summed over to produce the output array.

8. **What are the three rules of Einstein summation notation? Why?**
   - The three rules of Einstein summation notation are:
     1. If an index appears once and only once on the left-hand side and once and only once on the right-hand side of the arrow (`->`), it represents the output index.
     2. If an index appears once on the left-hand side and multiple times on the right-hand side, it represents the input index that will be summed over.
     3. Any index that appears on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side is considered a free index and will be retained in the output.
   - These rules help specify the desired tensor contraction operations in a concise and intuitive manner.

9. **What are the forward pass and backward pass of a neural network?**
   - The forward pass of a neural network involves passing input data through the network's layers sequentially to compute the output prediction. Each layer applies a transformation to its input and passes the result to the next layer until the final output is produced.
   - The backward pass, also known as backpropagation, involves computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters using the chain rule of calculus. These gradients are then used to update the parameters during the optimization process.

10. **Why do we need to store some of the activations calculated for intermediate layers in the forward pass?**
    - We need to store some of the activations calculated for intermediate layers during the forward pass because they are required during the backward pass for computing gradients. These activations are necessary for computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters of each layer through backpropagation.

11. **What is the downside of having activations with a standard deviation too far away from 1?**
    - The downside of having activations with a standard deviation too far away from 1 is that it can lead to issues like vanishing or exploding gradients during training. Vanishing gradients make it difficult for the model to learn, while exploding gradients can cause the optimization process to diverge.

12. **How can weight initialization help avoid this problem?**
    - Proper weight initialization can help avoid the problem of activations with standard deviation too far away from 1. Techniques like He initialization, Xavier initialization, or Glorot initialization are designed to initialize weights in a way that helps to keep activations within a reasonable range, preventing vanishing or exploding gradients and promoting stable training.
