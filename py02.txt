ans1 : The two values of the Boolean data type are typically "true" and "false".In Python, "True" and "False".
ans2:The three different types of Boolean operators are:
AND
OR
NOT

ans3:
Truth tables for each Boolean operator:
   - AND:
     ```
     A     B     A AND B
     --------------------
     True  True   True
     True  False  False
     False True   False
     False False  False
     ```

   - OR:
     ```
     A     B     A OR B
     -------------------
     True  True   True
     True  False  True
     False True   True
     False False  False
     ```

   - NOT:
     ```
     A     NOT A
     -----------
     True  False
     False True
     ```

ans4. Values of the given expressions:
   - (5 > 4) and (3 == 5): False
   - not (5 > 4): False
   - (5 > 4) or (3 == 5): True
   - not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)): False
   - (True and True) and (True == False): False
   - (not False) or (not True): True

ans5. The six comparison operators are:
   - Equal to (==)
   - Not equal to (!=)
   - Greater than (>)
   - Less than (<)
   - Greater than or equal to (>=)
   - Less than or equal to (<=)

ans6. The difference between the equal to (==) and assignment (=) operators is that the equal to operator (==) is used to compare whether two values are equal, while the assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, `if x == 5:` checks if the value of x is equal to 5, whereas `x = 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

ans7. The three blocks in the code are:
   spam = 0
   if spam == 10:
       print('eggs')
   if spam > 5:
       print('bacon')
   else:
       print('ham')
       print('spam')
       print('spam')
   

ans8. Code that prints different messages based on the value stored in spam:
   
   spam = 3
   if spam == 1:
       print('Hello')
   elif spam == 2:
       print('Howdy')
   else:
       print('Greetings!')
 

ans9. If your program is stuck in an endless loop, you can press `Ctrl + C` to interrupt the program's execution.

ans10. The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely, while the `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

ans11. In Python, `range(10)`, `range(0, 10)`, and `range(0, 10, 1)` are equivalent and all produce the sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. The difference lies in how the arguments are specified:
   - `range(10)`: Starts from 0 (default start value), ends at 9, with a default step size of 1.
   - `range(0, 10)`: Starts from 0, ends at 9, with a default step size of 1.
   - `range(0, 10, 1)`: Starts from 0, ends at 9, with a step size of 1.

ans12. Program using a for loop:
   
   for i in range(1, 11):
       print(i)
   

13. After importing the module spam, you can call the function bacon() using the dot notation:
    
    import spam
    spam.bacon()
