1. **Applications for Sequence-to-Sequence RNN**:
   - Machine translation: Translating a sequence of words from one language to another.
   - Text summarization: Generating a concise summary of a longer text input.
   - Chatbots: Generating responses to user queries or messages in natural language.
   - Speech recognition: Converting spoken language into text.
   
   **Applications for Sequence-to-Vector RNN**:
   - Sentiment analysis: Analyzing the sentiment expressed in a sequence of text.
   - Document classification: Assigning a category or label to a document represented by a sequence.
   - Video tagging: Assigning relevant tags or labels to videos based on their content.
   
   **Applications for Vector-to-Sequence RNN**:
   - Image captioning: Generating a descriptive sentence or caption for an input image.
   - Music generation: Generating a sequence of musical notes based on an initial vector input.
   - Time-series prediction: Predicting future values in a time series based on historical data.
   
2. **Encoder-Decoder RNNs vs. Plain Sequence-to-Sequence RNNs for Automatic Translation**:
   - Encoder-decoder RNNs are preferred for automatic translation because they can handle variable-length input and output sequences more effectively. The encoder encodes the input sequence into a fixed-size context vector, which the decoder then uses to generate the output sequence. This architecture allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and produce fluent translations.

3. **Combining CNN with RNN to Classify Videos**:
   - CNNs can be used to extract spatial features from individual frames of a video, while RNNs can capture temporal dependencies across frames. The CNN processes each frame to extract visual features, and the RNN processes the sequence of features to classify the entire video.

4. **Advantages of dynamic_rnn() over static_rnn()**:
   - `dynamic_rnn()` in TensorFlow allows for dynamic sequence lengths during training, making it easier to handle variable-length sequences. It automatically handles the unrolling of the RNN loop based on the input sequence lengths, whereas `static_rnn()` requires predefined sequence lengths.

5. **Dealing with Variable-Length Input and Output Sequences**:
   - Padding: Pad sequences with zeros to match the length of the longest sequence in the batch.
   - Masking: Use masks to ignore padded values during computation, preventing them from affecting the model's output or loss calculation.
   - Sequence lengths: Keep track of the actual lengths of sequences in the batch to dynamically adjust processing and avoid unnecessary computation.
   
6. **Distributing Training of Deep RNNs Across Multiple GPUs**:
   - Use data parallelism: Split the batch of sequences across multiple GPUs, compute gradients independently on each GPU, and then aggregate the gradients before updating the model parameters.
   - Implement model parallelism: Distribute different parts of the RNN model across multiple GPUs, allowing each GPU to compute forward and backward passes for its assigned portion of the model.
